MIST- I don't believe the sleepers in the house know where they are.  
SMOKE- They've been here long enough to push the woods back from around the house and part them in the middle with a path.  
MIST- And still I doubt if they know where they are.   And I begin to fear they never will. All they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered.

The sun was shining on the sea  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright  And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done –  
‘It’s very rude of him’ she said,  
‘To come and spoil the fun!
